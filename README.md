# PR Deep Link (Prototype)

This is a prototype for enhancing Pocket Relay by directly interfacing with the game code. 

This initial prototype can add messages to the main menu and is planned to be used for "Origin Confirmation Codes" to allow sending 
one-time login codes to Origin users through the in-game message terminal on the main menu so that they can set a password on their account without requiring an administrator to set one for them
